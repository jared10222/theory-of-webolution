      <h3>Why a logo?</h3>
      <p>Man's desire to claim ownership is inherent. Whether this is a result of pride, greed, or hope of immortality is personal. We mark our names on childhood drawings. We develop a signature, unique to each of us, to protect our identity. We carve initials into tree trunks with a heart, hoping to make a union permanent. <b>The logo is an extension of these acts. It redifines these motives from the individual to the collective.</b></p>

            	<td><h4>Mark</h4>
                <p>A recognizable symbol used to indicate ownership or origin of goods.</p>
                </td>
                <td rowspan="3"><h4>Wordmark</h4>
                <p>A wordmark uses the company name with propietary letterforms.</p>
                <p><b>Advantages</b></p>
                <p>The proliferation of logos in the world has made recognition of symbols very difficult. Using the entire name sidesteps the problem of recognition. When asked if the Mobil logo belongs to Mobil, most people would agree that it does. When asked who owned the Pegasus logo, many people would name other oil companies such as Chevron or Texaco. Mobile uses the Pegasus in addition to the wordmark</p>
                
                <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
                <p>If not handled skillfully, a wordmark alone may be generic and lack mnemonic value.</p>
                
                </td>
                <td rowspan="3"><h4>Symbol</h4>
                <p>The symbol is the iconic portion of a logo: The Chase Manhattan Bank symbol, the Cingular man, the Time Warner Cable eye/ear. At times the logomark may exist without the wordmark, examples being the Nike swoosh, Apple's apple, and the CBS eye.</p>
                <p><b>Advantages</b></p>
                <p>The benefit of utilizing a symbol alone follows the idea that "a picture is worth a thousand words." The eye/ear symbol is easier to read on an object such as a computer or hat, than the name Time Warner Cable.</p>
                
                <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
                <p>If the symbol is separated from the wordmark and the mark does not have equity it may be difficult to recognize.</p>
                </td>
                <td rowspan="3"><h4>Monogram</h4>
                <p>A design of one or more letters, usually the initials of a name, used to identify a company, publication, person, object, or idea.</p>
                
                <p><b>Advantages</b></p>
                <p>The monogram solves mnemonic and legibility issues. Fitting Wisconsin Energies on a one quarter page newspaper ad is much harder than using the WE monogram.</p>
                
                <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
                <p>Monograms are often masquerading as logos. Generic initials, treated in clever ways may look better on towels or glasses than on a corporate business card. Initials woven together have very little meaning. Most monogramatic logos depend on large-scale audience contact and repeated viewing for recognition.</p>

      <h2>10 Rules</h2>
      <ol>
      	<li>Answer who, what, why?</li>
        <li>Identify, don't explain</li>
        <li>Understand limitations</li>
        <li>Be seductive</li>
        <li>Make mnemonic value</li>

        <li>Design for a variety of media</li>
        <li>Be strong</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>1 - Answer who, what, why?</h2>
      
      <p>Before anything begins, the most basic questions that must be asked and answered are <b>"Who is the client?" "Who is the audience?" "What is needed?"</b> A logo should grow organically from the answers to these questions. Rather than imposing an idea onto the problem, the problem should dictate the solution. This is a statement repeated by every design teacher. Unfortunately, it is often ignored or misunderstood. It does not mean the whe whims of the client should be obediently followed. It does not mean that the designer's vision should be sublimated. <b>It does mean taht as much information as possible should be gathered, criteria developed, and creative work created, through the filter of the designer.</b></p>
      
      <p>Who is the client? In the simplest terms , this addresses the company's values, attitudes, and goals. Who is the audience? This may be answered demographically--women eighteen through thirty-four, or psychographically--athletic men who love adventure. And, more specifically, who makes the final decision on this logo?</p>
      
      <p>It is human nature to focus on our current needs; it is the designer's job to presuppose future needs. (What does the client want to be in the next year, five years, and ten years? long-term goals?)</p>

      </ol>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>2 - Identify, don't explain</h2>
      
      <p>We are identified, in good company, with names like John, Maria, or Frank. We prefer to not be called "the guy who lives on Maple Street and works at the pharmacy" or "the woman who has a beehive hairstyle and runs a trucking company". This is long-winded, confusing, and forgettable. In the same way, a logo should not literally describe the client's business; a logo is an identifier. The logo is a signpost that identifies the company and reflects its attitude and values.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>3 - Understand limitations</h2>
      
      <p>Here is the bad news: A logo is not a magic lantern. It can't make a bad product successful or save a poorly managed corporation. This is the good news: A well-designed logo will always help a good product realize its full potential. Smart design, along with the power of repetition, can make an enormous impact. The logo gives direction and attitude, while the product informs the meaning.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>4 - Be seductive</h2>
      
      <p>There is an enormous amount of dialog in design education and design oriented critical thinking about the irrelevance of pleasurable aesthetics. Over the past fifty years, the idea of logos as visually satisfying forms has been minimized. While this may play into fashionable cynicism, most people would prefer to be seduced by a mark than repulsed by one. The message must be the most important part of the identity's design, but the form must draw the viewer into it. Making visuals aesthetically seductive is another book, but logos are most successful when they are simple and dynamic.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>5 - Make mnemonic value</h2>
      
      <p>When we deconstruct how memory is made, we find there are four critical attributes of the process: (1) We see shape and color. All our visual recognitions are based on this. Is something square and red, or round and yellow? From the way we read letterforms, to the way we identify faces, shap and color form the basis of this skill. Once the shape and color of a form have been determined, we (2) position it within our understanding of historical continuity. We ask ourselves, "Does this look contemporary, Victorian, or Medieval?" "Does this have relevance to me at this time?"</p>
      
      <p>(3)We then use the information we have from learned responses to form meaning. We are taught very specific ideas: blue is masculine and pink is feminine, a red light means "stop", a green light means "go". (4)Mnemonic value is linked seamlessly with emotional association. This is the "wild card". It is personal and difficult to predetermine. If a green car hit you when you were a child, you may have an aversion to green. If your mother wears Chanel No 5, you may feel warm (or other more complicated emotions) when seeing the Chanel logo. Being aware of and utilizing these four attributes provides the tools to produce mnemonic value.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>6 - Pose a question</h2>
      <p><i>"If you can't explain the idea in one sentence over the telephone, it won't work," - Lou Danziger</i></p>
      
      <p>When we receive input from our senses, there is a question, "What is this taste?" and a response, "This is chocolate." We also do this when we watch television, listen to music, or read a book. This is part of our thinking process. The books and television programs we find the most unsatisfying are often the most predictable. If the viewer is given all the facts there is little reason for him to process the information. ALternatively, if the question is presented, and the viewer must provide an answer in his head, he will be forced to spend more time with the message and therefore become more intimate with it. There is a find line, however, between posing a question that invites a response and asking an unsolvable one. A visual solution that takes hours to interpret, or needs accompanying text will not succeed, and will soon be resigned from usage.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>7 - Design for longevity</h2>
      
      <p>Every hour we are barraged with an endless array of images and ideas. our visual landscape is composed of billboards and signs, television commercials, magazine advertisements, messages on packaging, and other forms of visual communication. Almost every one of these messages is combined with a logo, but many of these have little impact and are quickly forgotten. The ideas that connect are the ideas that resonate with us emotionally. Style and trends may be enticing, but they rarely have lasting emotional resonance. Marks that date quickly result from a concentration on "formal", rather than "conceptual" ideas. The logo must be able to convey its message over a long period of time and it must be able to adapt to cultural changes. It might be exciting to design a logo that is influenced by the typeface du jour, but it will quickly become embarrassing and will need to be redesigned in later years. Marks designed with a focus on current style and trends are often outdated in a short amount of time and soon become "quaint." There are very few clients who would like to be perceived as either outdated or quaint.</p>
      
      <p><b>Considerations that impact longevity:</b></p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Is the logo a strong representation of the client, as well as their current and future goals?</li>
        <li>Is the typography based on classic forms that will stand the test of time or does it depend on a style that will ultimately cause it to be trendy and short-lived?</li>
        <li>Is the iconography culture-specific or universal? The answer could impact future use.</li>
        <li>Is the logo well-crafted enough and aesthetically appropriate to exist unchanged for years?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>8 - Make the logo the foundation of a system</h2>
      
      <p>Like the foundation of a building, the logo is the base for all other messages. when the designer is in the process of designing a logo, it will be the only item on the computer screen. Often, when presented to a client, it will be the only item on the page. This is a mistake. The audience will never see the logo in a void. It will always be in context, accompanied by other visuals and ideas. It may be seen on business cards, on vans, and on top of buildings. If the logo is the foundation, the visual system is, to keep the construction metaphor alive, the framing of the structure. A visual system is derived from the logo. It does not copy the mark's form, but compliments it. The visual system will include guidelines for usage of color, typography, imagery, copy style, and product usage. Without these guidelines, very bad things can happen to the logo. Paryt hats could be put on it for Christmas cards, its color could be changed to something inappropriate, or it might be used as signage on the lobby floor, stepped on daily. The guidelines protect the mark and clarify the environment it occupies. This, consequently, protects the integrity of its message and the company it represents.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>9 - Design for a variety of media</h2>
      
      <p>The logo should now be legible and clear on a one-color newspaper ad, a website, three-dimensional signage, and on television. Most clients will have a predisposed idea of the logo's usage. At the time of its inception they may only intend to use the mark in print. Given the constant evolution of media and information delivery system, it would be very unique for the mark to exist only in one medium over its lifespan. Once again, it is the designer's responsibility to plan for the unplanned.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2>10 - Be strong</h2>
      
      <p>There is a fine line between intransigence and confidence, or between uncertainty and collaboration. The design process is often subjective, with logos and identity at the core of a sense of self. A client's love of red, for example, may be irrelevant to the strategy, but rejection of that idea may become a deeply personal issue. on the other hand, the designer may fall in love with the style of a logo that is not conceptually relevant. In order to reach a solution that solves the problems with sustainability, the final logo must address the client's goals and messages. Sidestepping the emotional landmines and personal politics is one of the most challenging aspects of the design process. While every situation is different, the best solution is to maintain a clear vision and connection to the primary goal. The designer, as an outside consultant, will be able to see the larger picture without being distracted by day-to-day operations. Frequently reminding the client of the desired outcome and central message is critical.</p>

      <h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>
      <p>Typography is pictures of words. The letterforms work together to convey a message. The attitude, history and culture of a company are conveyed with the letterforms of the logo.</p>

      <p>Letterforms can be thought of as clothing. A good pair of khakis and a white shirt will always be classic and will never look out of date. The addition of a unique tie or scarf will make the outfit personal. Long lived, classic typefaces are perceived in the same way. Alternatively, orange plaid pants and a pink tank top may get attention now, but as time passes they will become the focus of jokes when friends look at old photos. Trendy typefaces often suffer the same fate.</p>

      <h2 id="color">Color</h2>
      
      <p>In relationship to logo design, color is integral to mneumonic value. It also conveys the tone of the company.</p>
      
      <p>The idea of "owning" a color is one of the highest priorities of a logo and subsequent identity.</p>
      
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Hue:</b> The color itself, ranging from yellow to blue to red</li>
        <li><b>Saturation:</b> The purity of a color from gray to the most intense color value</li>
        <li><b>Value or tint:</b> The brightness of a color from black to white</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="lead">Color Meaning</p>
      <p>The human eye and brain experience color to produce a mental and emotional response. As a result of this, colors themselves have meanings.</p>

      <h2 id="image-iconography">Image/Iconography</h2>
      
      <p>When we talk about iconography here, we are discussing its role in the context of logo development. Icons are loaded. They can be very powerful and convey a Large amount of information quickly. They can, conversely, be oblique and neutral, allowing for a broad range of meaning. The style of execution impacts the tone and meaning. An icon created for a logo does not need to be a hard-edged, flat drawing of an abstract shape. While direct illustration of the subject matter is a mistake, various representational techniques can be utilized</p>
      
      <p>An apple acts as both a symbol of New York and of education. This may seem like a cliche, but cliches are, intrinsically, very recognizable. Such symbols shold not be disregarded but, rather, presented in a fresh form. The iconography should engage the view. Seeing recognizable signs in a unique form is a good way to achieve this goal.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">Types of Icon</p>
      <dl>
      	<dt>Diagrammatic</dt>
        <dd>Icons are simple representations of the structure of the subject matter. The process of thinking is conveyed by an asterisk in the Spark logo.</dd>
        
        <dt>Metaphoric</dt>
        <dd>Icons are based on conceptual relationships. A hat for a talent agency communicates trust, honesty, and old-fashioned values.</dd>
        
        <dt>Symbolic</dt>
        <dd>Icons are abstract images that have no clear relationship to the subject. Their only connection is their proximity to the subject. A nonrepresentational mark next to the name of a shoppping center is a symbol.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <hr />
      <h2 id="shape">Shape</h2>
		
      <p>A good logo will involve a shape that is appropriate and memorable. Shape is at the core of mneumonic value. Although is would be easy to say that a circle is the most successful shape for a logo, it would be untrue. There are logos made with squares, ellipses, triangles, and other unique shapes that are equally sucessful.</p>
      
      <p>It is also wrong to think that all logos must be contained within a shape. the overall form of a logo should comprise a shape. This is achieved by the letterforms and icon being constrained within a shap. Alternatively, the letterforms and icon can create an implied shape.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2 id="hierarchy-and-scale">Hierarchy and Scale</h2>
      <p>Myth: Everyone likes everything bigger. A logo must be able to exist as a twenty-five foot sign on a building, but it must also function on a business card. Intricate, complex, and layered forms might look incredible on the computer screen at 400 percent, but will become a jumbled mess on a CD label. Obviously, simple forms reduce best. Conversely, bad curves or sloppy kerning are only exaggerated on a fifty-foot billboard.</p>
      
      <p>The issue of hierarchy and meaning are interconnected. Is an individual product more important than the parent company? This depends on two questions. First, will it be advantageous for the client to be associated with the product? Second, will it be disadvantageous? If the connection with a product will position the client inappropriately there's a much bigger problem that needs to be addressed than just the size of the logo.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2 id="static-vs-changeable">Static vs. Changeable</h2>
      <p>The logo must serve as a central tool providing a cohesive voice for a wide range of applications. This does not necessitate that the logo be an intransigent, immutable object.</p>
      
      <p>Rather than allow someone else to make decisions about the changeable qualities of the logo, the designer should presuppose this scenario. Providing guidelines for motion, audio, and print is as important as choosing color. The action and reaction of the logo should reinforce the overall criteria and concept.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <h2 id="creating-a-kit">Creating a kit of parts</h2>
      <p>Identity design must be fluid. When the logo is complete, many more elements need to be created to make the logo truly usable in a variety of applications. An identity system needs to be designed that will be dynamic enough to allow for the ever-changing needs of the client. Therefore it is essential that designers create logos with flexibility in mind.</p>
      <hr />
      
      <p class="lead">CONSISTENCY OF CONCEPT</p>
      <p>It is important that the identity system functions as a cohesive group of visual and verbal elements that serve to continually identify the client to its target audience(s). Consistency is central to effective branding. This does not preclude creativity. An identity system will fail if it is predictable and lifeless. Power, clarity, and freshness must accompany consistency.</p>
      <hr />
      
      <p class="lead">CLARITY OF MESSAGE</p>
      <p>The role of the identity system is to provide a visible and obvious shorthand that supports the intended image of the client. To achieve this, every graphic element within the identiy system must clearly support the logo.</p>
      <hr />
      
      <p class="lead">ACCOMMODATING TO THE CLIENT</p>
      <p>When the system is developed, the designer must understand who wil use it and how they will use it. With this information, the designer will be able to create a system that is graphically appropriate, and cable of both accomodating the requirements and reflecting the personality of the client. The designer must create a system that can be customized within the constraints of the client's needs</p>
      <hr />
      
      <p class="lead">FLEXIBILITY FOR USERS</p>
      <p>The identity system must allow for an individual user's own modifications. As much as the original designer may not wish it, other creatives will use the identity system. Plan for enough variables in the system to keep the identity fresh.</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <h2>What is a kit of parts?</h2>
      <p>Quite simply, it is all the core aspects of a complete identity design program. All these elements must be thought through and carefully determined:</p>

<h2>Rollout: process and best practices</h2>

<p>Now that the logo is created, an identity system is designed, and everything is approved by the client, the next step is rollout. Rollout means actually putting the logo to use in real-world scenarios. In order to prepare for these various applications of the logo, designers create identity standards manuals. This allows the original designer to visualize all the information needed to implement the logo successfully. It requires thinking through every possible use of the logo, and providing specific guidelines for those uses.</p>

<p>Since the word design means to formulate a plan, creating a road map in the form of a standards manual is a key step in the process of designing a logo.</p>

<p>Standards manuals or guidelines allow identity systems to be managed properly--because they serve as the ultimate resource for consistent application of the logo throughout all communication and visual materials required by the client.</p>

<p>Manuals must be created to be useful to the widest possible group of logo users.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-standards-manual">Anatomy of a Standards Manual</h2>
<p class="lead">Graphic standards manuals can be slim and concise or multipaged behemoths, depending on the personalilty and needs of the client. Whether they are printed and bound pieces or whether they exist only on the client's intranet, identity guidelines are the key to consistent use of a logo.</p>

<p><b>As a point of reference, we suggest you include any/all of these things in a graphic standards manual:</b></p>

<hr />

<p>A manual can be as small as a one-page pdf file showing the logo, type, and color palette, or as large as a 300-page printed and bound book with a companion CD full of the same information in digital form. It can be printed with limited edition laser printouts or four-color process offset. The idea is to design a set of guidelines that serves the needs of both the identity system and the client. After the logo designing process, a designer will understand the work process and personality of their client. This information will help decide which format will be most successful.</p>
