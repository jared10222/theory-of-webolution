<h3 id="1">How to increase your focus</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Establish clear goals (list of steps)
    	<ul>
    		<li>Work with deadlines</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prioritize and ask yourself at every moment: "Is this necessary?"</li>
    <li>Push your limits</li>
    <li>Manage distractions</li>
</ol>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#1 Establish Clear Goals:

List Your Goals

Now go through your list and rank each goal with a number in priority order,
beginning with "1" as most important.

For each one, clearly identify the path you will take to get working on it.

Plan the future steps, in a logical manner.

<hr />
#2 Deadlines:

Take one important task and split it into specific deadlines.

Get rid of any nonessential work.

Use deadlines wisely - setting deadlines for every
task will only stress you and that will cause your focus to shift

<hr />
#3 Prioritize

Asses correctly how important a task is. Important tasks are
those that relate to your interest and larger life goals.

Once you have your to do list, list each item in order of descending
importance under one of the following categories:
<ul>
	<li>Urgent and important;</li>
    <li>important, but not urgent;</li>
    <li>urgent but not important;</li>
    <li>not important or urgent (pressing).</li>
</ul>

When deciding what to do, start with the urgent and important tasks first

<hr />
#4 Push Your Limits

When you feel that you cannot sustain your level of concentration,
convince yourself to give in five more minutes.

<hr />
#5 Manage Distractions

Respond to emails and phone calls in one block of time. Do not
forget that you don't need to deal with all of them every time
they ping to life.

It can take around 15-25 minutes for you to actually get into a real
state of concentration.

#1 focus on a limited number of things

Successful people focus all of their energy on a limited number of
important things and this is why they also obtain the results they want.

<hr />
#2 Excercise
Write down a list of all the things you do when it comes to your most important
project at work and approximately how much time you spend doing those things
on a daily basis.

Look carefully at that list and determine what the three things are that have
the greatest impact on what you are trying to accomplish.

Visualization is a well-developed method of performance improvement that
many successful people are using, irrespective of their fields.

Exercise: Create a detailed schema of what you desire and then visualize it
over and over again. Use all of your senses. What do you see? What do you feel?
What do you hear? What does it smell like?

<p class="lead">The brain exercises that you will choose have to be unfamiliar and out of your comfort zone.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#1. Count Backwards

In your mind, without saying the numbers out aloud, start counting
backwards.

Easy? Then try this, start counting again from 100, but skip the 4 digits 
in between for example 100, 96, 92 etc.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#2. Select an inspiring word or just a simple sound and think about it in your
mind, repeating it in your mind for 5 minutes.

Once your mind has begun to concentrate on it easily, move on to 10 minutes
of uniterrupted concentration.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#3. Try to suppress your thoughts for at least 5 minutes.

Start off with one minute and gradually increase the length of time. Try your best
to stay for 5 minutes without a single thought in your mind.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#4. Concentrate from within

Start by lying down and thoroughly relaxing your muscles. Now concentrate on your
heartbeat without paying attention to anything else.

Think about your heart and how it is pumping blood to every part of the body
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#5. Drawing and coloring are great activities to keep the brain relaxed
and to stimulate creativity

</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#6. Concentrating on Sleep

Put a full glass of clear water on a table in your sleeping room. Sit in a chair
beside the table and gaze into the glass of water and think how calm it is. Then
picture yourself getting into just as calm a state.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#7. Belly Breathing

Place on hand on your stomach.

Inhale slowly through your nose, and into your abdomen to make your stomach expand
for about three seconds.

abdominal muscles.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#8. The Chair Exercise

Pick a straight back, comfortable chair and sit. Make sure that while sitting, you
are not moving a muscle.

Your body shouldn't move a millimeter except your chest and nostrils, for breathing.

You may not be able to do it for more than five minutes at a stretch, but practice
hard and fix a target of fifteen minutes
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#9. Breathing in and out

Sit upright on a chair or on the ground, with your head and back in a straight line.
Press your index finger against your right nostril and breathe in gently through
your left, mentally ticking off ten seconds.

Now remove your finger and exhale through your right nostril, again taking ten 
seconds to do so. Repeat the whole procedure with the other finger and left nostril.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#10. Noise Cancellation

The ideal place to do this will be on a park next to the road.
Close your eyes and take a stock of all the sounds around you.

Pick a sound and concentrate on it, blocking out everything else.

After two or three minutes, switch your focus to another
sound and concentrate on it, ignoring everything else in turn.

<h3 id="6">How to train your brain to get into that state of focus</h3>

<p class="lead">Once you understand why your mind gets distracted, you are able to train your brain to concentrate better.</p>

<p>When you are focused, both sides of your brain are working together and are able to block out what's going on around you.</p>
<p>When your focus state is broken, it can take you up to 25 minutes to regain it. Every time it gets broken, you have to start over again.</p>

<p class="lead">How can we take control of a wandering mind for a more productive life?</p>
<ol>
	<li>Work out on what is causing the wandering in the first place;</li>
    <li>Turn off your email so you don't keep getting pinged when one comes in;</li>
    <li>It's essential to be completely aware of your thought processes and to stop any impulse to think about something else, before this happens.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p class="lead">Train your brain for the focus mode</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#1. make the task you have to complete more relevant.

How can you do this?

Place your most important task at the top of your to do list and the least
important at the bottom of your list. Define as well a short deadline.

Once completing it by the deadline, offer yourself a reward.

<hr />
#2. When multitasking, you lose the ability to focus as distraction
becomes a habit.

By turning off all distractions and committing your attention to a single
task, you start building the muscle to be focused.

You can start small, maybe five minutes per day, and work up to larger timeframes.
If you find your mind wandering, just return to the task at hand.

<hr />
#3. In order to learn how to focus on important tasks, use entertainment as
a form of training.

Choose a good book, and read it that passionately, that you are unaware of the
world around you: that is true focus.

Whether it is a good book, a great film, or your own work, the end goal is the same:
your focus level.

It doesn't really matter what form of entertainment you use. But whatever you choose,
it must be challenging and you must be actively focused on whatever you are doing.

<hr />
<h3 id="7">How stress and anxiety affect your focus</h3>
<p>Your purpose should be to make stress and anxiety a healthy, manageable part of your life.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#Exercise

Take a pen and list all your reasons to be stressed and all your worries.
Analyze worries and see if they are worth your attention or not. Tackle those
that deserve your focus.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
Walk away from the task for a few moments to calm down and collect your thoughts.
Stepping away from it may allow you to return to the task with a new 
perspective and renewed energy.
==============================
Deeply concentrate on each breath, and especially on the breath leaving as you 
exhale. Focus your attention on your breathing until you are paying
attention to nothing else.
</div>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
The key to managing stress and worries is to assess whether the fear and worry
that you are feeling is rational or irrational.

Once you have set aside your irrational worries, you can begin to evaluate
the necessary actions to resolve those that are rational.

Only tackling those worries that merit your time, will bring you at that point
of achieving excellent focus.
