<h3 id="narrow">Narrowing the topic</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Given a broad topic, you need to decide what specifically you want to write about</li>
    <li>Used for all writing situations: proposals, essays, or letters. You name it.</li>
    <li>Prewriting strategies: Brainstorming, Freewriting, Mapping, Research, Journaling, or Questions.</li>
    <li>Turn your editor off for all of these idea generating strategies</li>
</ul>

<h4>Brainstorm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Good for Narrowing a Topic</li>
    <li>Great for generating raw ideas</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">How to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Moving down the page</li>
    <li>A listing exercise</li>
    <li>No editor - quantity before quality</li>
    <li>Timing/ 20-25 topics</li>
    <li>Look for Sample Brainstorm</li>
</ul>

</pre>

<h4>Mapping (or Webbing)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Great for visual learners</li>
    <li>Also known as webbing</li>
    <li>It is a visual brainstorm</li>
    <li>Circle in the middle with your topic written in middle</li>
    <li>Draw lines to circles with supporting ideas</li>
    <li>Around those circles you can draw lines to another layer of details.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Freewriting</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Great for a tapping into the unconscious mind</li>
    <li>Write across the page.</li>
    <li>Seems like sentences and paragraphs, BUT
    	<ul>
        	<li>No thoughts of grammar</li>
            <li>Don't even stay within line</li>
            <li>If you get stuck repeat words or day dream don't lift your pen or pencil</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Times exercise: 1, 3, or even 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Great for more creative writing</li>
</ul>

<h4>Research, Journal, Questions</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Research:</b> Go online and search the topic to read the latest articles or essays. Get the tenor of conversation; then begin to notice what points you should focus on.</li>
    <li><b>Journal:</b> Take notes as you research; scribble down ideas for your own paper as they pop in to your head.</li>
    <li><b>Reporters Questions:</b> Who, What, When, Where, Why and How. Answer these questions to generate ideas.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3 id="working-thesis">Working Thesis</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Topic</b> The over all most general idea of the writing.</li>
    <li><b>Controlling Idea:</b> What you specifically want to say about this general topic.
    	<ul>
        	<li>Example: Blue Cheese is a very general topic</li>
            <li>Controlling idea is: east coast people only dip wings in blue cheese.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Working thesis means that the thesis can still be changed or refined as you gather supporting details and learn more about the topic.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<div class="nocode">
#working thesis

<h3 id="raw-support">Generate raw support</h3>

<h4>Generate Raw Supporting Ideas</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Raw idea means uncooked, quick, unrefined, as many as possible.</li>
    <li>Use multiple Strategies</li>
    <li>Look at working thesis first before each pre write
    	<ul>
        	<li>Try a times Brainstorm first: goal is 10-15 ideas, facts, or reasons, etc.</li>	
            <li>Now us a Mapping Exercise, try to go three levels of detail. Write working thesis in middle, the next level are key support details, and then add more specific details around those.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
